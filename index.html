<h1 style="text-align:center;">MY FIRST WORK</h1>
<p style="color:rgb(4, 12, 4);"> It was a few days ago when i decided to learn HTML. I believe that was not a bad decision, though the work has proven not to be easy but i don't want to give up.   
<br>their are several elements to note and getting to know them all is mot an easy task.
<h1 font-size="30px"> these are some of the elements i've learned. </h1>
<pre>
1. <q>title</q>
2. <q>font-size</q>
3. <q>font-family</q>
And 26 more.

</pre>
Learning html as easy as it may sound, is not actually so easy.
